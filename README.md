### Microsoft December Python Coding Challenge

**Part 1 - The Twelve Days of Christmas**

In this part, you'll create a script to provide images for the Twelve Days of Christmas song. Each time you run the script, it should get different images (within reason, though if you decide to programmatically generate them rather than scrape them off the web... ðŸ¤”).
 
Feel free to get creative here - there are plenty of fun possibilities! The output should be twelve image files (JPEG or PNG), randomly named, and recognizable enough for part two...
 
 
**Part 2 - How Many Days of What?**

In this part, create a script that accepts twelve randomly named image files that represent the Twelve Days of Christmas (from part 1) and will rename them to Day<whatever>.jpg (or .png).
 
How? Completely up to you! Depending on how creative you (or your friends/enemies) have been in part 1, this could be challenging, but there are also some not-quite-obvious strategies that can give you an advantage!
